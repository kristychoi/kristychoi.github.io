	<p>Hello world!</p>

	<p>	It's done -- the blog setup is complete! I've been meaning to get on this for a while now. 
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/why-i-taught-myself-to-procrastinate.html?_r=0">
	Creative procrastination</a> seems to be all the rage nowadays, so I figured that the summer before I officially 
	become a quasi-unemployed member of society is as good of a time as ever to start.</br></br>

	Just kidding. I'm actually really excited for grad school. There's something both crazy 
	and adrenaline-rush exciting about the thought of spending the next 5
	(6? 7? before I die?) years doing research. Think about it. When will be the next time 
	that you can define "productivity" as "hitting up all the hottest new 
	releases on the arXiv?" Or traveling to conferences and sharing ideas 
	with some of the brightest and most motivated people in your field? Sounds pretty cool 
	if you ask me.</br></br>

	But in reality, it <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/">seems</a> 
	like this whole 
	<a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~wallach/how_to_be_a_successful_phd_student.pdf">
	PhD process</a> <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm"></a> is a  
	<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf">marathon</a>
	where the ups and downs are entirely different beasts on their own. I think this
	<a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> comic sums it up rather nicely:</br></br>
	<img src="../images/phd_ambition.gif" class="centerImage" style="width:600px; 
	height:250px"></br>
	
	To be honest I get a bit nervous if I think about it for too long. So this blog is meant to 
	be a space where I can un-focus from the seriousness of it all and document the 
	enjoyable steps I take along the way: small tidbits of life, fun 
	slices of projects, or attempted explanations of topics that I find interesting (I include 
	the last bit to hold myself accountable. I think academic blogs are super cool but I 
	haven't found the motivation to write anything yet).</br></br>

	Here's to a month left of summer and many more posts to come!<br>
